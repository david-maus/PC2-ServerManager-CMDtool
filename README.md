## **Server starter / Weather randomizer / Configurable per .ini**
**Just install the dedicated server, get the wrapper, make your inis and start the server**

**No more editing or copy configs for certain functions on serverupdate / fresh install / steam file verify**

*** ------Linux support coming soon / Video & Pictured tutorial coming soon------***

The Dedicated Server Wrapper is a little tool  that allows you to configure your
Project Cars 2 Server on a per .ini base.
Instead of edit and configure all the different files for the server
(server.cfg, rotatefile, motd, statsfile etc.) you can configure a session with
just one single .ini file.

You can make infinite .ini files / server configurations. Without edit the server files again and again.

One of the main features is the weather randomizing. You can set the chance in % for the possible weather states (You can of course deactivate things like snow, storm etc.). The wrapper fills the weatherslots randomly, based on your chance settings after every serverstart (If you activate it).

For authentic weather you can activate the option "AuthenticWeather". With this option
the first QualifySlot is the same as the last PracticeSlot and the first RaceSlot is the same as
the last QualifySlot. No more complete weather change from one session to another.

## **How to install**

1. Download the ServerWrapper [here](https://bitbucket.org/david-maus/gef-gaming.de_pc2-ds-wrapper/downloads/)

 After copy:

 `C:\_GAMES\Steam\steamapps\common\Project CARS 2 - Dedicated Server\gef-gaming.de_pc2-ds-wrapper`

---

## **How to use / Standard**

1. In the configs folder:

    `C:\_GAMES\Steam\steamapps\common\Project CARS 2 - Dedicated Server\gef-gaming.de_pc2-ds-wrapper\configs`

    You find a `basic.ini`
2. Edit this file for your server/session
3. Start the server under:

    **Windows**

    `C:\_GAMES\Steam\steamapps\common\Project CARS 2 - Dedicated Server\gef-gaming.de_pc2-ds-wrapper\bin\win`

    with `PC2DedicatedServerWrapper.exe`

    or

    **Linux**

    `C:\_GAMES\Steam\steamapps\common\Project CARS 2 - Dedicated Server\gef-gaming.de_pc2-ds-wrapper\bin\lnx`

    with `PC2DedicatedServerWrapper`


---

## **How to use / Multiple Configurations**

1. In the configs folder:

    `C:\_GAMES\Steam\steamapps\common\Project CARS 2 - Dedicated Server\gef-gaming.de_pc2-ds-wrapper\configs`

    You can create multiple *.ini files like the `basic.ini`

    For example:

    `CUP_R01_Zolder.ini`
    `CUP_R02_LeMans.ini`
    `CUP_R03_NÃ¼rburgring.ini`

    Just copy the basic.ini multiple times and edit the names and settings.

## **Additonal Parameters**

`PracticeServer`

Disabling dateprogression, Mandatory Pitstop, license.

Sets weatherprogression to realtime,
practice & quali to 24 hours, race to 1 Lap and password to "".
Useful if you want the same server (under the week, between cup races) for
practice the next track. And without edit your ini files.

`Sunshine`

Overrides all weatherslots with "Clear" and sets all sessions to 1 slot.
Useful if the server is bugging with changing weather. Its the case at the moment i think - 10. March 2018


### You can pass these parameters to the wrapper to override some settings without alter your ini files:

`PC2DedicatedServerWrapper.exe CUP_R01_Zolder.ini PractiveServer`

`PC2DedicatedServerWrapper.exe CUP_R01_Zolder.ini Sunshine`

`PC2DedicatedServerWrapper.exe CUP_R01_Zolder.ini PractiveServer:Sunshine`

## Startscript Generator

Under

`C:\_GAMES\Steam\steamapps\common\Project CARS 2 - Dedicated Server\gef-gaming.de_pc2-ds-wrapper\bin\win`

you find the

`GenerateStartscripts.exe`


If you execute it, all your ini files in the configs folder are getting a proper startscript under

`C:\_GAMES\Steam\steamapps\common\Project CARS 2 - Dedicated Server\gef-gaming.de_pc2-ds-wrapper\bin\win\startscripts`


### Example on Windows
`CUP_R01_Zolder.bat`

`CUP_R01_Zolder-PractiveServer.bat`

`CUP_R01_Zolder-Sunshine.bat`

`CUP_R01_Zolder-PractiveServer:Sunshine.bat`

You can then simply start the right .bat file to start the server with the correct .ini file

## Known issues & Infos

- **BACKUP YOUR DEDICATED SERVER FILES if you dont want to loose configs etc.! Im not responsible for maybe a dataloss or something! The tool is only tested by me at the moment. Please use it carefully!**
- There are very little errorchecks, so if you make something wrong there is maybe no errormessage or something
- Of course it can happen that some things dont work. Please report it and i will fix it.
- Simple motd config in ini coming soon
- You must place  the tool/folder in the right position like in the tutorial. If you dont make it correct it cant be started and can maybe cause errors or bugs
- At the moment all variables/values must be in the ini files. If you delete some of them for readability it is not working
. Maybe there are some values case sensitive in the ini at the moment. Be Careful and read the comments above the settings.
- GUI is maybe coming
- Linux support is coming soon
- Feel free to edit the source, im not a python expert. The code is quite messy and repetetive.
